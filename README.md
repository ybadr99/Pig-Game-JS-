# The-Pig-Game

## Description:

<p align="justify">
  A simple game, played with one die, which requires a score sheet. Each player in turn throws the die and continues to throw the die until either a 1 is thrown or they decide to stop.  If a 1 is thrown they score nothing for that turn.  If they elect to stop before a 1 is thrown they score the total of the numbers thrown in that turn.  The scores are noted for each turn and the player who obtains a total score over 100, wins the game, provided they are not then out-scored by a subsequent player who has thrown one fewer rolls and still has a turn left.

## Rules:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds:
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6'es in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
  Players can set the winning score (in an input field), so that they can change the predefined score of 100.
